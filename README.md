# Sample Website Practice

Practicing how to build websites with **Flask** and **Django**.  
Learning full-stack web development one project at a time.

## 🧠 Purpose
This repo is for experimenting with backend frameworks, templates, and routes.  
I’m learning how to:
- Connect frontends (HTML/CSS/JS) with backend logic  
- Handle user input and forms  
- Manage databases  
- Deploy small web projects  

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Python 🐍  
- Flask  
- Django  
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  

## 🚀 Goal
To understand how websites actually work — from code to deployment.  
AI helps, but I’m building everything myself to *really* learn how it works.  

> “AI can make things faster, but learning by doing makes you better.” 💪
